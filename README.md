LCD-Pixel-Display-Bitmapper
===========================

Javascript image convertor for nokia display.
Tested for Chrome 25. 

Working on an Arduino project with a display I needed an image convertor that converts images to 96x65 bitmaps.
And to list an array of bytes to use in an arduino compiler project. Will upload that code later.
This thing does just that.


It still has some bugs in scaling images.
