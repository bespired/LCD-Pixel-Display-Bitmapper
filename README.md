LCD-Pixel-Display-Bitmapper
===========================


Small javascript paint program to create small bitmaps ( 84x48 pixels by default ).

<img src="https://github.com/bespired/LCD-Pixel-Display-Bitmapper/blob/master/baby.png" />

Draw pixels, lines, squares and circles with a toolbox interface. ( text not implemented yet ).
Load and Dither any image from your disk.

Save/Load image to localstorage.
Download image as bytes in a file.
Print them in c++ format in a window.



Tested for Chrome 25. 

Working on an Arduino project with a display I needed an image convertor that converts images to 48x48 bitmaps.
And to list an array of bytes to use in an arduino compiler project. Will upload that code later.
This thing does just that.
